Applied mathematician with keen interest in neuroscience, probability, stochastic processes, and
machine learning, and software engineering. I love to share ideas and knowledge, so throwing
together a blog about these topics was inevitable.

Occasionally I feel like summarising and putting my thoughts to the page. The content I post here
will be along the lines of things I randomly find interesting, stuff I've read, interesting and/or
useful things I've learned, and summaries of how I work. I'll also occasionally post about my
projects here.
